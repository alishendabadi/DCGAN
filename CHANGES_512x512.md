# DCGAN Changes for 512x512 Images

This document outlines the changes made to adapt the DCGAN project from 64x64 images to 512x512 images.

## Overview

The original DCGAN was designed for 64x64 images. To support 512x512 images, significant architectural changes were required due to the much larger image size.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Architecture Modifications

#### Generator
- **Original**: 5 layers (4x4 → 8x8 → 16x16 → 32x32 → 64x64)
- **New**: 8 layers (4x4 → 8x8 → 16x16 → 32x32 → 64x64 → 128x128 → 256x256 → 512x512)
- Added 3 additional transposed convolution layers to reach 512x512

#### Discriminator
- **Original**: 5 layers (64x64 → 32x32 → 16x16 → 8x8 → 4x4 → 1x1)
- **New**: 8 layers (512x512 → 256x256 → 128x128 → 64x64 → 32x32 → 16x16 → 8x8 → 4x4 → 1x1)
- Added 3 additional convolution layers to handle the larger input

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### train_dcgan.py
- Changed `image_size` from 64 to 512
- Reduced `batch_size` from 64 to 16 (to handle larger images and prevent memory issues)
- Updated all layer dimensions in Generator and Discriminator

#### config.py
- Updated `IMAGE_SIZE` from 28 to 512
- Changed `IMAGE_CHANNELS` from 1 to 3 (RGB instead of grayscale)
- Reduced `BATCH_SIZE` from 64 to 16
- Updated feature arrays for both Generator and Discriminator

### 3. Visualization Updates

#### All visualization functions updated:
- Increased figure sizes from 8x8 to 20x20 inches for better visibility
- Added proper RGB image handling (removed grayscale assumptions)
- Updated DPI and bbox_inches parameters for better quality output

### 4. Files Modified

1. **train_dcgan.py** - Main training script with architecture changes
2. **config.py** - Configuration parameters
3. **generate_samples.py** - Sample generation and visualization
4. **quick_test.py** - Quick testing script
5. **test_setup.py** - Setup verification script

## Memory Considerations

- **Batch size reduced**: From 64 to 16 to prevent GPU memory overflow
- **Larger model**: More layers mean more parameters and memory usage
- **Training time**: Will be significantly longer due to larger images and more parameters

## Usage

The project now works with 512x512 RGB images. Place your training images in the `./data/` directory and run:

```bash
python train_dcgan.py
```

For quick testing:
```bash
python quick_test.py
```

To generate samples from a trained model:
```bash
python generate_samples.py --model_path checkpoints/final_model.pth
```

## Requirements

- More GPU memory (recommended: 8GB+ VRAM)
- Longer training time
- Larger storage space for samples and checkpoints

## Notes

- The architecture now has 8 layers instead of 5, which increases model complexity
- Training will require more epochs to converge due to the larger image size
- Generated images will be much higher resolution (512x512 vs 64x64)
- Consider using gradient clipping if training becomes unstable
