# DCGAN Changes for 256x256 Images

This document outlines the changes made to adapt the DCGAN project from 64x64 images to 256x256 images.

## Overview

The original DCGAN was designed for 64x64 images. To support 256x256 images, architectural changes were required to handle the larger image size while maintaining good performance.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Architecture Modifications

#### Generator
- **Original**: 5 layers (4x4 → 8x8 → 16x16 → 32x32 → 64x64)
- **New**: 7 layers (4x4 → 8x8 → 16x16 → 32x32 → 64x64 → 128x128 → 256x256)
- Added 2 additional transposed convolution layers to reach 256x256

#### Discriminator
- **Original**: 5 layers (64x64 → 32x32 → 16x16 → 8x8 → 4x4 → 1x1)
- **New**: 7 layers (256x256 → 128x128 → 64x64 → 32x32 → 16x16 → 8x8 → 4x4 → 1x1)
- Added 2 additional convolution layers to handle the larger input

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### train_dcgan.py
- Changed `image_size` from 64 to 256
- Increased `batch_size` from 64 to 32 (good balance for 256x256 images)
- Updated all layer dimensions in Generator and Discriminator

#### config.py
- Updated `IMAGE_SIZE` from 28 to 256
- Changed `IMAGE_CHANNELS` from 1 to 3 (RGB instead of grayscale)
- Increased `BATCH_SIZE` from 64 to 32
- Updated feature arrays for both Generator and Discriminator

### 3. Visualization Updates

#### All visualization functions updated:
- Adjusted figure sizes to 12x12 inches for optimal visibility of 256x256 images
- Maintained proper RGB image handling
- Kept high-quality output with DPI and bbox_inches parameters

### 4. Files Modified

1. **train_dcgan.py** - Main training script with architecture changes
2. **config.py** - Configuration parameters
3. **generate_samples.py** - Sample generation and visualization
4. **quick_test.py** - Quick testing script
5. **test_setup.py** - Setup verification script

## Memory Considerations

- **Batch size optimized**: Set to 32 for good balance between memory usage and training efficiency
- **Moderate model size**: 7 layers provide good capacity without excessive memory usage
- **Training time**: Moderate increase compared to 64x64, but much faster than 512x512

## Usage

The project now works with 256x256 RGB images. Place your training images in the `./data/` directory and run:

```bash
python train_dcgan.py
```

For quick testing:
```bash
python quick_test.py
```

To generate samples from a trained model:
```bash
python generate_samples.py --model_path checkpoints/final_model.pth
```

## Requirements

- Moderate GPU memory (recommended: 4GB+ VRAM)
- Reasonable training time
- Standard storage space for samples and checkpoints

## Notes

- The architecture now has 7 layers instead of 5, providing good capacity for 256x256 images
- Training will require more epochs than 64x64 but fewer than 512x512
- Generated images will be high resolution (256x256) with good detail
- This is a good balance between image quality and computational requirements
